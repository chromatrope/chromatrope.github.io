## Hello Matt!#

I have managed to succesfully create a Jekyll blog on the [Chromatrope](http://chromatrope.co.uk) git hub. I'm getting my head around it all, but seems to be fairly straightforward.

I'd love to take on the Radar work for you - would you have a bit of time for a chat this week so we can get the ball rolling..? I can do end of the day tomorrow (Wednesday 17th)at NBH, or next week I'm in London on Monday and Thursday.
